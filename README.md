# Fake-News-Detection-ML-Project

In this fake news detection project, we aimed to classify news articles as either real or fake using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset, loaded from a CSV file, included columns for authors, titles, and labels. We began by preprocessing the data, filling any missing values and combining the author and title into a single 'content' column. Next, we implemented text preprocessing, including stemming and removing stopwords, to clean the textual data. Using `TfidfVectorizer`, we transformed the text data into numerical feature vectors. We split the dataset into training and test sets and trained a Logistic Regression model, achieving training and test accuracies of approximately 97% and 93%, respectively. To enhance model performance, we experimented with additional classifiers: Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting. The Random Forest classifier achieved training and test accuracies of 100% and 93%, respectively, while the Decision Tree classifier achieved accuracies of 100% and 92%. The Gradient Boosting classifier yielded accuracies of 100% for training and 93% for testing. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of various machine learning models in detecting fake news and highlights the importance of text preprocessing and feature extraction in achieving high classification accuracy.
